04/2012 mendelson opensource AS2 1.1 b39

Enhancement:
*A retry of the connection attempt has been implemented if it fails the first time
*MDN Auto recovery on server start has been added: If the server has been shut down and there are pending outbound MDN they are send after the server is up again and the MDN wait time has not been expired
*If a transaction has been manually resend the original name is kept now and the transaction is marked as "resend"
*A new temporary directory for files is used, this is below the installation directory now and no longer the systems temp directory
*A new web interface is included. The password file for the web access access is ".passwd" (found in the installation directory). The default web interface URL is http://yourhost:8080/webas2/ now.
*The underlaying database engine has been upgraded and the structure is incompatible, it is HSQLDB 2.x.x now. That means that an additional update script has to be started once if you upgrade from an earlier version of mendelson opensource AS2. The AS2 server will inform you if such an external update is required and how to perform it.
*The database has been splitted, there is a configuration database and a runtime database now. The split will be performed on the first server start if the software is updated from an older version of the mendelson AS2

Changes:
*The JMS interface has been removed

Fixes:
*There has been a wrong format for december in the HHTP header if the locale is FR
*The MDN wait time starts at the message send time now, was at message creation time


Updates:
Update to commons IO 2.1
Update to VAADIN 6.7.3
Update to HSQLDB 2.2.7

Hint:
The mendelson opensource AS2 will run fine with Java 64 bit VMs. If you have problems with the memory consumption please install a 64 bit java VM (not included), patch the VM with the "jurisdiction policy strength files" (Oracle download) and set the main memory of the JVM to 4 GB



09/2011 mendelson opensource AS2 1.1 b37

This is a maintenance release - it just fixes one configuration problem - it does not contain any change in the processing unit

Enhancement:
*A progress bar has been added for some operations in the client
*Added the AS2 message subject to the event replacements

Fixes:
*The default value for the SSL keystore password was wrong, this leaded to the error message "Keystore was tampered with, or password was incorrect" if you try to send messages
*Fixed a unmarshalling problem at config import
*No notification mail has been send on send error
*Error in the french versions localization at the partners event screen

08/2011 mendelson opensource AS2 1.1 b35

Enhancement:
*A status file for outbound transactions has been added again, this was removed in the prior version
*New logdata structure: There is a logfile per day now in a single sub directory, the format is log/CCYYMMDD/as2n.log
*To prevent flooting your partners AS2 server with messages the max number of messages to send per poll attempt could be defined in the partner settings now. All existing polls are set to the default value of 100 outbound transactions per poll. Please modify these settings if it does not fit your needs after an update.
*User interface: a progress bar has been added for some operations (e.g. storing the partner settings)
*The delivered keystore contains now the mendelson CA root certificate as trusted certificate
*If a certificate/key has been deleted outside of the application (e.g. by using portecle) this is displayed
in the related combobox now by a special icon

Fixes:
*The private key of an entry has not been found if there are two similar entries
in the keystore (one key pair and one public key)
*Problems sending XML data have been fixed. The problem occured if the data has been transmitted uncompressed, unsigned and unencrypted (which is very uncommon)
*The partner/user specific events have not been processed for outbound connection problems
*If the signature of an MDN could not be verified the transaction was disregarding this fact set to green
*The linux start script ignored the command line parameters
*There was a problem in setting up the HTTP authentication for data upload/MDN in the partner panel
*If an MDN had a content transfer encoding set there occured a processing error on the MDN. The error
message was "The MDN references a AS2Message with the message id "null" that does not exist."

---------------------------------------------------------------

05/10/2007 mendelson opensource AS2 1.0 b17

*Data compression is supported (AS2 1.1 feature). It could be set up per partner. Please remember that your TP has to support AS2 1.1 or higher for this feature

*MDN options have been ignored so far (disposition-notification-options). Now it is possible to ask mendelson opensource AS2 for unsigned MDN or single signature algorithm only. mendelson opensource AS2 will still ask for signed MDN and allow SHA-1 and MD5 in answers.

*If the inbound message contains attachments (AS2 1.2 feature) mendelson opensource AS2 now returns a processing error MDN with the message that attachments are not supported.

---------------------------------------------------------------

03/13/2007 mendelson opensource AS2 1.0 b15

*Web interface to monitor the server. The default URL is http://localhost:8080/mec_as2/monitoring.jsp, user: guest, password: guest

*Fixed a bug in the proxy support

---------------------------------------------------------------

01/19/2007 mendelson opensource AS2 1.0 b13

*The server has a persistent message queue now as processing queue, based on JMS. The server integration could now be realized not only by sending files to an outbox dir of a specified partner but also by sending data to the JMS server.

*It's possible to define a directory poll interval per partner

*Its possible to define a file pattern ignore list per partner for the directory polls. This allows to copy file to the partners outbox directory and enable the poll on the file by renaming it

*The GUI "send message to partner" operation no longer copies the file into the polled outbox dir but sends it directly to the as2 server message queue

*Related software update: updated HSQLDB to v1.8.0_7, Bouncycastle to 1.35.

*Enhanced server log to create links between processed filenames and the AS2 message ID for external log processing
