<h2><a name="overview" id="overview"></a> Overview</h2>
<p>Participants of every AS2 communication are you (localstation) and your trading 
  partners. This is why the interface uses two different icons for these parties:</p>
<table width="75%" border="0">
  <tr>
    <td width="4%"><img src="../images/localstation16x16.gif" width="16" height="16"></td>
    <td width="96%">Local station (you)</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td><img src="../images/singlepartner16x16.gif" width="16" height="16"></td>
    <td>Trading partner (TP)</td>
  </tr>
</table>
<p>The configuration of a partner differs depending if it is the local statation 
  or the trading partner. The partner configuration GUI will not show some options 
  if you are the TP/localstation. Please don't be confused about this.</p>
<p>There has to be defined always min one local station for the server. You could 
  create as many local stations as you wish, this allows to present different 
  identities.<br>
  Please remember that most settings in this panel belong to the remote partner. 
  That is why the number of visible tabs is reduced if you have configured a partner 
  as &quot;local station&quot;.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h2><a name="settings" id="settings"></a> Settings</h2>
<p>The partner settings define the behavior of the server depending on a partner 
  in many ways: The following paragraph describes these settings:</p>
<p><strong>Misc:<br>
  <br>
  </strong>Every TP and the local stations use an internal name (for the as2 server 
  only) and a public AS2 id. The AS2 id must be sent to your partners to allow 
  them to identify your messages.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Security:<br>
  </strong><br>
  This product supports encryption and digitial signature of AS2 messages. There 
  are different encryption algorithm and signature algorith. You and your trading 
  partner have to chose the same algorithms else the communication will fail.<br>
  Please make an appointment with your partner about these AS2 communication settings.<br>
</p>
<p><strong><br>
  MDN (Message Delivery Notification):</strong></p>
<p>The AS2 protocol requires a receipt acknowledgement for every sent message. 
  This ack is called &quot;<strong>MDN</strong>&quot; (<strong>Message Delivery 
  Notification</strong>). A transaction is completed if the MDN to sent data arrives. 
  There are two different types of MDN transfers: sync MDN and async MDN. Mainly 
  it depends on the message receiver with mode to select. If you chose the sync 
  MDN mode the MDN is sent on the same HTTP connection the message has been sent/received 
  on. In this case there is no information needed to which URL a MDN should be 
  sent to. If you chose the async MDN the AS2 messages contains information of 
  where to send a MDN to. Because of this the sender of a message has to define 
  a MDN URL in this case.<br>
  The EDIINT standard does not define on how long to wait for a async MDN before 
  setting the transaction on error. Mainly this time is set to 30 min but this 
  could be defined in the AS2 server settings.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Directory polling:</strong></p>
<p>There are different possiblities to send messages to the AS2 server in this 
  product. You may use JMS or you could directly copy the data to an outbound 
  directory of a defined partner. The poll manager for every partner will pick 
  up these files, enwrapp them into AS2 messages, encrypt and sign them (is requested). 
  This setting defines the bahavior of the poll manager per partner.<br>
  Its possible to define file patterns or a list of files that should be ignored 
  by the polling process.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Receipt:</strong></p>
<p>It's possible to transmit the filename of a AS2 transmisson. Anyway this is 
  not standardized and not every AS2 product supports this option.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>HTTP authentication:</strong><br>
  <br>
  Beneath message encryption, digital signature, TLS (transport layer security, 
  SSL) its also possible to define an additional passwort for the HTTP receipt. 
  This could be set here.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Notification:</strong></p>
<p>If you use message quota you could setup the quota notification here.<br>
  <em><strong>Attention:</strong></em><br>
  You have to activate this configuration possibility in the settings first (&quot;Interface&quot;).</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>HTTP Header:</strong></p>
<p>Allows to reconfigure the HTTP headers of the AS2 messages and add new ones. 
  Please be careful using these settings because its possible to stop the communication 
  to a partner if you overwrite some reuqired AS2 Headers.<br>
  <em><strong>Attention:</strong></em><br>
  You have to activate this configuration possibility in the settings first (&quot;Interface&quot;). 
</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Send:</strong></p>
<p>The AS2 messages are sent and received via HTTP or HTTPs. To perform this you 
  need the receipt URL of your TP for every communication. Please contact your 
  TP to get these data.<br>
  Please do not change the default settings for subject and content type of the 
  message unlike you TP requests to change them.<br>
  It's also possible to set the content transfer encoding per partner. This is 
  &quot;binary&quot; by default, you could also set &quot;base64&quot;.<br>
  There are multiple AS2 versions out with different features. If your TP uses 
  a AS2 solution &gt;= AS 1.1 you may compress the message data to reduce the 
  sent data size.<br>
  <br>
</p>
<p><strong>Events:</strong> </p>
<p>For every inbound and outbound message there could be executed a user defined 
  and partner specific command line command. This shell command may contain somehow 
  the pattern &quot;${filename} &quot;, this will be substituted by the payload 
  file name after the MDN has been received or a communication error occurs during 
  sending the message. There are some other variables available for the replacement 
  - please have a look at the AS2 Client for a current implemented list.<br>
  There are two different commands: one for a successful sent message, one for 
  a failed send approach.</p>
<p>Sample: <br>
  If you would like to execute a batch file on windows that will work on an outbound 
  payload after sending for a specified partner please set up something like the 
  following:</p>
<p><code>cmd /c mybatch.bat ${filename}</code></p>
<p>On Linux/UNIX the exact command depends on the used shell, e.g. <code>ksh -c &lt;command&gt;</code> 
  for the KShell or <code>bash -c &lt;command&gt;</code> for the bash.</p>
<p><br>
  For example on Windows<br>
  You want to copy the received file to &lt;filename&gt;.edi. Therefor you create 
  the following shell script:</p>
<p>copy.cmd:<br>
  <code>copy %1 %1.edi</code></p>
<p>Then write the following into the text box to run a command after receipt:<br>
  <code>cmd /c copy.cmd ${filename}</code></p>
