Please download the installer, execute it and let it install directly over the existing installation. There are some personal filse that must not be overwritten. The installer will ask if you want to overwrite them, answer with NO to keep your personal settings.
Afterwards start the mendelson opensource AS2 server. It will perform some database upgrades. If any additional steps are required the program will inform you.
