* originally downloaded source version 39 from CVS repo [(here)](http://mec-as2.cvs.sourceforge.net/viewvc/mec-as2/39/ "Mendelson AS2 b39 Source").
* according to the folks at mendelson, they were unable to upload to module b39, so uploaded to 39 instead.  that's why b39 is empty.
* extracted tarball (mec-as2-39.tar.gz) to ./src
* renamed folder "39" to "de" to satisfy java package name
